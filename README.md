# Azure Digital Twins Postman Collection

The repo contains a single postman_collection.json file that contains a postman collection of requests to the Azure Digital Twins APIs. Currently the focus of the collection is on on the data plane and includes Models, Query, and Twins.

We will continue to add updates to the collection on a regular basis until all data plane and control plane API requests are created. If you have any suggestions or problems please create an issue. If you have any question or want to discuss something, please post in the discussion tab.

For more information on the APIs used in this collection and instructions for using Postman with Azure Digital Twins, please see the following resources:
